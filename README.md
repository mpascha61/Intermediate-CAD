### Reflection
-Remember to drag along lines to create them exactly straight before placing sketches

### Reflection
Creation was simple since it was just following instructions given with gifs of exactly what to do. (Literally just following instructions to finish it all)
Keep in mind to not forget to use the "use tool"

### 2.3 Wheel/Bearings
### Description
Third part in the process of the creation of the skateboard, gets mated around a point in the trucks

### Reflection
Be default extrusion of the bearing sends it in the direction of the wheel, needs to be flipped

### 2.4 All Put Together
### Description
Final product, all 3 parts together in an assembly

### Reflection
Mirror things such as screws by selecting the screw then the face of the object its getting mirrored on so that screw only needs to be placed once.
