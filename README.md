## Skateboard

### Description
Model Skateboard created in onshape w/ seperate parts of the deck, wheels, and trucks

### 2.1 Deck
### Description
First part of the skateboard as well as simplest to create, holds everything together

### Reflection
-Remember to drag along lines to create them exactly straight before placing sketches

### 2.2 Trucks 
### Description
Second part of the skateboard that consists of the baseplate, hanger, and bushing

### Reflection
Creation was simple since it was just following instructions given with gifs of exactly what to do. (Literally just following instructions to finish it all)
Keep in mind to not forget to use the "use tool"

### 2.3 Wheel/Bearings
### Description
Third part in the process of the creation of the skateboard, gets mated around a point in the trucks

### Reflection
Be default extrusion of the bearing sends it in the direction of the wheel, needs to be flipped

### 2.4 All Put Together
### Description
Final product, all 3 parts together in an assembly

### Reflection
Mirror things such as screws by selecting the screw then the face of the object its getting mirrored on so that screw only needs to be placed once.

### 3.1 - Creation of The First Brick
### Description
2x4 sized lego brick, linear patterns used to simplify creation of studs

### Reflection
First time using variables in CAD, highly usefull for having to repeat the use of number(s) in part studios

### 3.2 - Expanding the Brick 
Added a mass of configurations, allowing the user to freely change the size of the brick by controlling the studs, for example 2x4-1x2, as well as whether it is a brick, plate, or tile, as well as being able to change the color (red/blue/yellow in this case)

### Reflection
Creation requires a lot of patience the first time, majority of this step is setting up the variables/configurations of them.

### 3.3 - Building the Duck
### Description
Final assembly using the differently sized lego bricks to create a lego duck using snap mode

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71345181/141314840-e1b83d65-6b35-49e2-bedd-8a5e6a7efacf.png)

### Reflection
Assembling the duck in the end, only 1/4-8 mate connectors showed up when trying to snap the parts together, making it impossible due to the lack of mate connectors shown up, to fix it I went back to the part studio, edited linear pattern 1 and applied show per instance under the second direction of the pattern.
