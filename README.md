## Skateboard

### Description
Model Skateboard created in onshape w/ seperate parts of the deck, wheels, and trucks

### 2.1 Deck
### Description
First part of the skateboard as well as simplest to create, holds everything together

### Reflection
-Remember to drag along lines to create them exactly straight before placing sketches

### 2.2 Trucks 
### Description
Second part of the skateboard that consists of the baseplate, hanger, and bushing

### Reflection
Creation was simple since it was just following instructions given with gifs of exactly what to do. (Literally just following instructions to finish it all)
Keep in mind to not forget to use the "use tool"

### 2.3 Wheel/Bearings
### Description
Third part in the process of the creation of the skateboard, gets mated around a point in the trucks

### Reflection
Be default extrusion of the bearing sends it in the direction of the wheel, needs to be flipped

### 2.4 All Put Together
### Description
Final product, all 3 parts together in an assembly

### Reflection
Mirror things such as screws by selecting the screw then the face of the object its getting mirrored on so that screw only needs to be placed once.

### 3.1 - Creation of The First Brick
### Description
2x4 sized lego brick, linear patterns used to simplify creation of studs

### Reflection
First time using variables in CAD, highly usefull for having to repeat the use of number(s) in part studios

### 3.2 - Expanding the Brick 
Added a mass of configurations, allowing the user to freely change the size of the brick by controlling the studs, for example 2x4-1x2, as well as whether it is a brick, plate, or tile, as well as being able to change the color (red/blue/yellow in this case)

### Reflection
Many steps of this aren't fully understandble to me as of right now, but it was a smooth process with no speedbumps
